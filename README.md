# React-Django-Todo-App
This is a Todo application using React in the front end and Django framework in the backend

First let's talk about the Techstack<br /> 
In backend Django was used, I have used DjangoRestFrameork which helped in creation of API. <br />
The Front-end is a simple react web application.<br />

Now the functionlity,<br /> 
We can create a task, update it using edit button and delete it usnig '-' button. <br /> 
Also when a task is completed we can just cut it out. <br />

All this can be seen on Django's Server i.e on localhost:8000 <br />

Notes: <br />
To see backend functionality please use localhost:8000/api  <br />
Also install all the requirements beofre-hand, They are listed below <br />
<br />
1) Django <br />
2) DjangoRestFramework <br />
3) Django CORS Headers <br />

For frontend First please do a npm install, then try to run it on localhost:3000. <br />
if it works properly, please do an npm build using npm run build command. <br />
Once this is completed, You can finally view your whole To-Do App on 'http://localhost:8000/' <br />
